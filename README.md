# NLTK_clutter

POC for training and deploying a model making use of the [Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)](https://www.nltk.org/) with and without further annotation, designed to flag paragraphs of text in editorial articles which are embedded in the article body but do not belong to the article text. The paragraphs can generate "false positives" when indexing the article body for use with Elastic search.
